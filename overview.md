#### What we found out?

- Efforts for building applications with hand-coding are high
- Development and delivery of business applications is slow
- Extending business applications and processes is difficult

However companies would like to innovate with speed and less effort

- It takes too much time, even for professional developers, to on-board and to be productive in the cloud
