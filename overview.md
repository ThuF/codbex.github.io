<b>codbex</b> provides an innovative approach for building, deploying, selling and operating open source business applications in the cloud.

Building a healthy partner network is a primary goal for <b>codbex</b>. The players within the business ecosystem all have different requirements, skills and motivation factors. <b>codbex</b> on one hand side, provides all the needed development tools, deployment model, marketplace, payment provider integration, collaboration tools and on the other hand establishes a set of rules, to ensure the fairness in the business partners relationship.

#### What we found out?

- Efforts for building applications with hand-coding are high
- Development and delivery of business applications is slow
- Extending business applications and processes is difficult
- The end result is increased:
  - Setup and Training costs
  - Development and Deployment costs
  - Maintenance and Upgrade costs
  - Entrance barrier to the cloud

However companies would like to innovate with speed and less effort

#### What is the pain today?

- The time to market is too slow, usually it takes more than 9-12 months, per business application to be developed and released to the customers
- The traditional hand—coded software is not “bug free” and require continuous support with cost ratio up to 7x compared to the development cost
- It takes too much time, even for professional developers, to on-board and to be productive in the cloud

#### In the news

- “By 2024, low-code application development will be responsible for more than 65% of application development activity”
  - Gartner
- “By 2024, three-quarters of large enterprises will be using at least four low-code development tools for both IT application development and citizen development initiatives.”
  - Gartner

#### Low-Code market size as of today

- $46.4 billion by 2026, rising at a market growth of <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/12/2047509/0/en/The-Global-Low-Code-Development-Platform-Market-size-is-expected-to-reach-46-4-billion-by-2026-rising-at-a-market-growth-of-25-CAGR-during-the-forecast-period.html">25% CAGR</a>
- $3.8 billion in 2017
- $21.2 billion by 2022, expected
- $46.4 billion by 2026 is the predicted market size
- 25% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
- 75% of the Large Enteprises are going to use at least four Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP) by 2024
- 65% of all application development will happen in LCAP by 2024

#### Who is affected today?

- We've spoken to
250+ users and individual contributors in the context of Low-Code development and high- productivity tooling
- The feedback is positive and they are dreaming about using high-productivity tools, that are lowering the entrance barrier to the cloud
  - “Designing and integrating application business processes is complex task and takes too much time”
  - “Changes in the application domain model requires experienced professionals and is error-prone”
  - “Development is up to 10 times faster with Low-Code tooling”

Customers and partners are expecting from us to lower the entrance barrier to the cloud for newcomers and to boost their productivity.
