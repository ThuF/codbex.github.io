Hades Edition includes all necessary features for Database Management for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SAP HANA, H2 and more.

It provides capabilities for database modeling and management, such as Database Explorer - where the database metadata can be inspected,
SQL Console - where any SQL query can be executed against the selected data source, Preview - where the results of the query execution can be seen in tabular format, Data Transfer - for on-line schema replication, Data Sources - where the set of the connected databases can be managed.

### Databases

It visualizes the database related views in a specialized perspective focused on the database administrator tasks. It can be easily deployed on any hosting environment as a Docker container, so that the database inspection and quick changes can be done in a more secure way than exposing the database port itself.
